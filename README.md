# Generate Changelog

This project is extended from [generate-changelog](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog) and used for my company, just for reference purpose

Generate a changelog from git commits. This is meant to be used so that for every patch, minor, or major version, you update the changelog _prior_ to running `npm version` so that the git tag contains the commit that updated both the changelog and version.
